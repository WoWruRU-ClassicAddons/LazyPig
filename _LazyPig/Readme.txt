NEW in v1.7 
Added new feature record/replay for repeatable quests that allows you to complete them extremely fast.
To record just hold down the Shift key and complete the repeatable quest, after that talk to the NPC again and all
the previous actions will be auto replayed, remember not to release the Shift key.

New in v1.8
Added split feature
- alt + right click will split stack to half
- shift + right click will split stack (default split result is 1 to change it type: /lps value  - where value must be between 1-99)
